# driver_Drowisness_Detection
 Driver-Drowsiness-Detection Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language. The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library. The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which  we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.
 
 The 68-landmark detector data (.dat) file can be found "https://shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat"
